<!--
1. In CSS - 
Selector - directly
Id - use # 
Class - use dot to use in external style sheet

     Three ways of writing CSS
    1. in this style tag here in head
    2. style within in tag as style=""
    3. having external style sheet then intsert it
        <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
        much more organised
